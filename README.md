To run the project locally on your machine: 

Make sure you have node, npm and expo-cli on your computer.

Node: https://nodejs.org/en. For HomeBrew users, you can install node with `brew install nodejs`. npm is included with nodejs, so there is no need for additional installation for nodejs.

Install expo-cli with `npm install -g expo-cli` .

Ensure everything is working fine by running these three commands:

`npm --version`

`node --version`

`expo --version`

---

`cd` to the directory you want your project to be in.

Type in `git clone https://github.com/mvpclub/cp3405-sp53-2019-assignment2-full_stack_beast_-_group-6.git` 

After you've cloned the repository, `cd` into the frontend directory by typing `cd Front-end`

`npm start` to install all the required dependencies.

`expo start` to begin the Metro Bundler and run on your desired platform.
